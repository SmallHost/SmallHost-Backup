# SmallHost Backup
⚠️ **You need WinSCP installed for this to work!** You can [install WinSCP here](https://winscp.net/download/WinSCP-5.19.4-Setup.exe) (11.3 MB). To ensure SmallHost Backup works, at WinSCP installation install it to all users (not just you). Without WinSCP, SmallHost Backup cannot connect to the FTP server to get your files.

Moving from SmallHost to another host? Want to make sure your files are okay in case of data loss? You might want to back up your files. I made it easy by making this tool.

1. [Click here for the raw backup.bat file.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmallHost/SmallHost-Backup/main/backup.bat)
2. Run keyboard command `CTRL + S`.
3. Under the `Save as Type` dropdown, select `All Files`. At the end of the file name, type `.bat`.
4. Save it.
5. Run it.
6. If you have Windows Defender, click `More Info > Run Anyways`.
